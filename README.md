# VR Puzzle Game - Proof of Concept
By [Aimone Bodini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimone-bodini-phd-7a05b5a6/)

This Unity project is a virtual reality game I developed during the Xmas break out of curiosity to test a game mechanic. Here's why it's a POC. 
I aimed to create a game that could only be played through the VR medium, leveraging its unique features. 
It is designed for the Oculus Quest 2 and consists of three levels with increasing difficulty.

## Getting Started
To use this project, you'll need:
- Unity Hub installed.
- A Unity version compatible with Oculus Quest 2 development.
- TextMeshPro package installed in Unity.
- Oculus Quest 2 device for testing.

## Usage
- Open the project in Unity.
- Ensure the TextMeshPro package is installed.
- Make sure to assign the necessary references (e.g., elapsedTimeText, combinedConditions) in the Inspector.
- Test the game on your Oculus Quest 2 device.

## Disclaimer
It is not intended to become a full game, and I have no plans to make any significant updates. If you make something with it, though, I'd love to hear from you.

Have fun!
